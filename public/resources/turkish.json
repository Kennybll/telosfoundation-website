Telos is a new project based on the EOS network. The EOS source code is open source and freely available to fork.

          "Simply, it is that all Telos genesis addresses will receive the same number of tokens as their corresponding EOS addresses held in the genesis snapshot—up to a maximum of 40,000 tokens. There are a few exceptions to this policy: Addresses proven to have been stolen, phished, or misregistered, thereby depriving their rightful owners of them, will be restored to new addresses controlled by their rightful owners; and new genesis tokens will be created to compensate the Active Block Producers (ABPs) and establish the Telos Foundation."

        "question": "If you cap all accounts, how can EOS holders get TLOS from exchanges?",
        "answer": [
          "The TLOS block producers have the ability to create new tokens by a vote of 2/3+1. The 6 ABPs agree to create new tokens for distribution for any exchange that can show EOS holdings on the snapshot and that agrees: to list TLOS; not to vote the exchange account; and to request and distribute only enough coins so that all EOS holders at the time of the snapshot receive their coins capped at 40,000 per account. The ABPs will have a process in place for exchanges to petition them to create TLOS tokens and promise to honor all valid petitions. (It will require a vote of 5 of the 6 block producers to accomplish this.) Once Telos activates and the elected block producers validate the network, it will take a vote of 15 of the 21 block producers to create new tokens for exchanges."

        "answer": [
          "The largest 1,050 EOS addresses control about 90% of EOS tokens and therefore completely control block producer selection, their voting, and ultimately the entire network. This makes the system dangerously centralized. By capping genesis addresses at 40,000 TLOS — approximately the 90th percentile of ownership — Telos will be one of the most evenly distributed major blockchains in existence. 162,930 addresses will have exactly as many TLOS as they did EOS. The total TLOS token supply will be lowered to approximately 200-400,000,000 TLOS tokens depending on how many exchanges petition to recreate their wallets.

        "answer": [
          "The EOS network will succeed or fail based on its own merits. We hope it succeeds, as we are all deeply invested in this project. However, the EOS mainnet release has revealed problems with the system that will be difficult to resolve on the EOS blockchain. “Whales” have shown that they generally just vote for their own block producer partners and even game the rewards system to harm other block producers— this may also be expected once worker proposals emerge. The EOS network is under the control of a few whale accounts. We offer a fresh approach where all token holders’ voices matter. Telos also hopes to provide a testbed for new ideas that may eventually be adopted by the EOS mainnet. In this way we hope to strengthen EOS."

They can’t easily change the results of their sale—especially by reducing the tokens of their largest contributors, which is really the key change that fixes the system. Telos is a completely new system that never took money from nor made promises to anyone. We intend to build a network using the open source EOS software (that we all helped pay for) to create an entirely new network that better represents the true purpose of EOS."

        "answer": [
          "TLOS tokens will not gain value until the Telos mainnet launches and they are able to be traded. In practical terms, TLOS will gain real value when exchanges accept them to trade against other cryptocurrencies. We expect that this will happen because exchange customers will demand that they be given access to their tokens. The technical requirements for listing TLOS will be identical to EOS so we expect little resistance on that point. Once tokens are freely trading on exchanges they will find their value based on supply and demand. The TLOS token supply will be between one-fifth and one-third that of EOS, and Telos should be as good as or better than EOS. Telos will also not have any “whale” addresses which often are responsible for price manipulations in other coins."

The people launching Telos include block producers, developers, social media marketers, arbitrators, and others working together in a largely decentralized way. Members of the Telos Launch Group will be compensated in the TLOS genesis file. A Telos Founders Reward Pool (TFRP) will be created in the Telos genesis file containing 6M TLOS (about 1.8% of the expected money supply). This fund will be distributed among members of the Telos Launch Group – an open-membership group established to create and launch Telos – based on tasks performed by members. The exact method of TFRP distribution is yet to be determined but will be formalized prior to network launch."

        "answer": [
          "Members of the Telos Launch Group are taking a central role in creating and launching Telos. They are bearing the costs and contributing the effort to bring the network to life. To compensate their work and defray cost they incur, they are being granted new genesis tokens on the Telos blockchain distributed from the Telos Founders Reserve Pool. These tokens are of zero value at the genesis and will only gain value if the TLG, Telos Foundation, and other participants can launch a valuable network. This approach is in line with bounty programs common in cryptocurrency launches. The total amount of compensation for the many founders/bounty recipients is ~1.8% of the expected TLOS token supply, which is a low number for cryptocurrency projects where large amounts of work are required and no funding has been sought."

        "question": "What is the Telos Foundation?",
        "answer": [
          "The Telos Foundation is the organization initially launching Telos. Prior to the Telos mainnet launch, the Telos Foundation will organize technical, informational, and marketing efforts to advance Telos. The Telos Foundation will manage the Telos genesis file that is subject to validation by the 6 ABPs. Immediately upon the mainnet launch, the Telos Foundation will cede its authority to the 6 ABPs to be governed by the Telos Constitution and voting rules. After mainnet launch, the Telos Foundation will function as an independent promotion and funding body for Telos. Its function will be to pay for projects that are not selected for worker proposals or that cannot yet be funded due to inadequate funds (particularly early in the life of the network.) The Telos Foundation may apply for worker proposal funds to reimburse funds dispersed as the goal is to create an ongoing fund that is not depleted. It will also seek to stabilize RAM prices by regularly publishing a guidance price and buying below that price, selling above it, and offering RAM for sale or lease to bona fide developers seeking to develop on the network. The Telos Foundation is a decentralized organization that votes on its own issues via smart contract. It does not serve or seek any official governance position and will remain neutral on block producer candidates and proposals. Addresses owned by the Telos Foundation will never vote."

            "Having received a B.S. Biological Sciences (2007) and a B.S. Nursing (2010) from Louisiana State University, Blake Lagarde’s journey towards arbitration candidacy is a unique one. He has spent his decade long professional career as a Registered Nurse, presently at Children’s Hospital in his home town of New Orleans.  What he lacks in traditional law practice is made up by first hand experience with and a passion for EOS and Telos (and Ethereum by proxy) blockchain token recovery.  Nearly 2 weeks after the EOS Genesis Snapshot and Mainnet launch, Blake personally created the now 1,300 member EOS Lost Non-Compromised (Genesis) Key Group on Telegram--an EOS 911 partner.  He has also served as an administrator for the 2,200 member EOS 911, known together with the former as the \"EOS Lost Key Community.\"  He has led the effort to find a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@blaketlagarde/safe-recovery-of-eos-genesis-accounts-with-lost-non-compromised-private-keys-944d48a6dde6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">solution</a> for those with lost non-compromised genesis keys (as well as some fringe cases).  He penned the EOS Lost Key <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/eos-block-producers-ecaf-a-solution-for-individuals-with-lost-non-compromised-eos-private-keys\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Petition</a> which has garnered the support and signature of over 1,700+ individuals.  Through Blake’s personal outreach the Lost Key movement has also received endorsement or support from over 30 EOS Block Producers, many of whom fill the ‘Top 21’ today.  Because of the work in and commitment to the EOS Lost Key community, he was approached by Douglas Horn to join the Telos Launch Group (TLG) with a focus on token recovery.",
            "Per Douglas Horn, as a member of the TLG, \"[Blake has] been an important part of [telos launch group]. [Blake] brought a lot of credibility for us in the Lost Key community at a time when people still did not know whether they could trust us. For those who do not know, Blake played a key role in getting the ECAF to reach out to their entire email list about Telos key recovery. And he diligently worked with people who were having problems [with telos token recovery] He also prevented a lot of thefts from people testing our process.\"",
            "From pioneering the EOS lost key effort, to being the first EOS holder to receive a lost key claim ruling from the ECAF, and personally working on telos token recovery support and validation; the next logical step in Blake’s intimate journey through the world of cryptocurrency and lost or stolen private keys is to become an official Telos Arbitrator.  To date, Blake has already assisted 160 individuals recover their 300,000+ telos tokens.  He looks forward to the future as an opportunity to continue to help those with blockchain issues on a more official basis.",
            "When Blake is not advocating for those with lost keys, his time is spent with his life partner of ten year, Dr. Anneliese Boettcher (PhD Neuropsychology), and their two beautiful mutts Hubie (in picture) and Sula.  When Blake and Anna are not at a music festival or catching a local artist play a show, they are both active members in NOLA’s Mental Health Advocacy Sources, such as the Brett Thomas Doussan Foundation, with a focus on suicide prevention."
